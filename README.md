# passwd-reordering
This bash script copies the passwd file to your home directory and reverses the order of words in each line.

This was the first script i wrote after a short intro to bash scripting.

It is probably very inefficient and useless. (Who would want to reverse their passwd file??) 

# How to run?
This script should work in most Linux environments.
- Save the script to your home directory
- Open the shell
- Type this in the shell `bash passwd-reordering.sh `
- It should ouput the reversed *passwd* file and also save it to `ouput.txt` also found in your home directory.

# Additional Information
  This script assumes that you run in in your home directory.
